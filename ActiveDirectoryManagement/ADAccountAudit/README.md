# ADAccountAudit

Read-only Active Directory reporting tool for single-crewed or small-team sysadmins. Finds stale accounts, disabled-but-privileged accounts, accounts with a password about to expire, and empty security groups, and writes the results to an HTML report and CSV export. Makes no changes to Active Directory.

## Overview

`ADAccountAudit.ps1` checks four things on every run:

1. **Stale accounts** — enabled accounts with no logon activity in `-StaleDays` or more (default 90), based on `LastLogonTimestamp`.
2. **Disabled accounts in privileged groups** — accounts disabled but still holding membership (including nested/recursive membership) of one or more groups named in `-PrivilegedGroups`.
3. **Expiring passwords** — enabled accounts whose password will expire within `-PasswordExpiryWarningDays` (default 14), using the computed `msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed` attribute, so fine-grained password policies are respected. Accounts with `PasswordNeverExpires` set are excluded.
4. **Empty groups** — security groups with zero members. Distribution groups are excluded by default, since they carry no access implications; pass `-IncludeDistributionGroups` to include them.

It's designed to run unattended via Scheduled Task: no prompts, exit code 0 on success, exit code 1 on any fatal error. Old logs and reports beyond the configured retention window are cleaned up automatically at the start of each run.

## Usage

```powershell
# Run with all defaults
.\ADAccountAudit.ps1

# Custom stale threshold, custom privileged groups, include distribution groups
.\ADAccountAudit.ps1 -StaleDays 60 -PrivilegedGroups @("Domain Admins","Backup Operators") -IncludeDistributionGroups

# Scope to a specific OU
.\ADAccountAudit.ps1 -SearchBase "OU=Users,OU=London,DC=contoso,DC=com"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-StaleDays` | int | `90` | Days since last logon after which an enabled account is flagged as stale. |
| `-PasswordExpiryWarningDays` | int | `14` | Days before password expiry to flag an account. |
| `-PrivilegedGroups` | string[] | `Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, Schema Admins, Administrators` | Groups checked (recursively) for disabled-but-still-privileged membership. |
| `-SearchBase` | string | domain root | Distinguished name to scope all searches to a specific OU. |
| `-IncludeDistributionGroups` | switch | off | Also reports empty distribution groups, not just security groups. |
| `-OutputRoot` | string | `C:\Pickering-Cloud\ADAccountAudit` | Root folder for logs and reports. |
| `-LogRetentionDays` | int | `30` | Days to retain log and report files before automatic cleanup. |

## Output

- **HTML report** — `<OutputRoot>\Reports\ADAccountAudit_<timestamp>.html`. Colour-coded findings with a summary count at the top.
- **CSV exports** — one per finding category, alongside the HTML report: `..._StaleAccounts.csv`, `..._DisabledPrivileged.csv`, `..._ExpiringPasswords.csv`, `..._EmptyGroups.csv`.
- **Log file** — `<OutputRoot>\Logs\ADAccountAudit_<timestamp>.log`.

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- ActiveDirectory PowerShell module (RSAT). The script attempts to install this automatically if missing — `Add-WindowsCapability` on Windows 10/11 client, `Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell` on Windows Server — which requires an elevated session. If automatic installation isn't possible, the script logs the exact manual command and exits.
- Read access to the domain. No elevated AD permissions are required beyond standard authenticated-user read access, since this script only reads, it never writes to AD.

## Known limitations

- `LastLogonTimestamp` replicates across domain controllers with up to 14 days of lag by design. Treat stale-account findings as approximate, not exact, particularly near the threshold boundary.
- Has not been run against a live domain by the author at the time of writing. Test with `-SearchBase` scoped to a small OU before running against the full domain, particularly the password expiry and empty-group logic, which are the two areas most likely to need adjustment for a given schema/environment.
- Does not remediate anything. This is a reporting tool only; any account or group changes are left to the administrator, or to a separate tool that consumes this one's CSV output.
